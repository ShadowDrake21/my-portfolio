# Main functional advantages

1. Multilingualism
   Here was implemented ngx-translate which allows us to user templates of any languar we want or it supports.

2. Using GitHub Rest API
   By using this API we can manipulate with Github data, in this case with data of my own profile and my projects.

3. Angular Material
   What could be better than working with this component-based framework easily and with grace?

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
